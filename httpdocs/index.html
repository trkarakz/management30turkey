						maintaining the <strong>happiness of workers</strong> as a

					</p>
					<h3>Management 3.0 is for</h3>

				<h3 class="centered">A Management 3.0 Two-Day Workshop Schedule
					Example</h3>
				<p class="centered">There's no doubt that each workshop is as
					unique as the managers and team leaders that attend. But while
					companies and employees differ, many of the challenges are shared.
					Here is an example of what a typical Management 3.0 two-day
					workshop might look like, but, rest assured, classes are customized
					for each group.</p>
				<div class="col-md-6">
					<h3>Management 3.0 Topics: Day 1</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Agile management</b> is a proven approach to
							leadership and governance of creative teams and people. You will
							learn about different methods, popular practices, challenges in
							Agile adoption around the world, and the contribution of the
							manager and team leader in Agile organizations.</li>
						<li><b>Complexity thinking</b> is the cornerstone of an Agile
							mindset. You will learn what complexity theory is, how to think
							in terms of systems, about the difference between complex and
							complicated, about fallacies of traditional linear thinking, and
							suggestions for complexity thinking.</li>
						<li><b>Intrinsic motivation</b> is the reason people get out
							of bed in the morning. Since people are the most important parts
							of an organization and managers must do all they can to keep
							people active, creative, and motivated. You will learn about the
							difference between extrinsic motivation vs. intrinsic motivation,
							the ten intrinsic desires, and common techniques for
							understanding what is important to the people in your teams, such
							as one-on-one meetings, personal assessments, the 12 most
							important questions, and 360 degree evaluations.</li>
						<li><b>Self-organization</b> can offer many answers when it
							comes to good management. Teams are able to self-organize, but
							this requires employee empowerment, authorization, and trust from
							management. You will learn how to make self-organization work,
							how to distribute authorization in an organization, the
							challenges of empowerment, how to grow relationships of trust,
							and several techniques for distributed control, such as the 7
							levels of delegation, and authority boards.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-6">
					<h3>Management 3.0 Topics: Day 2</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Goal setting</b> is important, since self-organization
							can lead to anything. Therefore it's necessary to protect people
							and shared resources, and to give people a clear purpose and
							defined goals. You will learn when to manage and when to lead,
							how to use different criteria to create useful goals, about the
							challenges around management by objectives, and how to protect
							people and shared resources from any bad effects of
							self-organization.</li>
						<li><b>Competence development</b> is key when it comes to
							doing a good job. Teams are only able to achieve their goals if
							team members are capable enough, and managers must therefore
							contribute to the development of competence. You will learn how
							and when to apply the seven approaches of competence development,
							how to measure progress in a complex system, the effect of
							sub-optimization, and several tips for useful metrics.</li>
						<li><b>Organizational structures</b> significantly impact how
							an organization works. Many teams operate within the context of a
							complex organization, and thus it is important to consider
							structures that enhance communication. You will learn how to grow
							an organizational structure as a fractal, how to balance
							specialization and generalization, how to choose between
							functional and cross-functional teams, about informal leadership
							and widening job titles, and about treating teams as value units
							in a value network.</li>
						<li><b>Change management</b> is one of the things people in
							all kinds of organizations struggle with most. People, teams, and
							organizations need to improve continuously, in order to defer
							failure for as long as possible. In practice this means that
							managers and leaders must act as change agents, trying to change
							the social complex systems around them. You will learn about the
							4 facets of change management, which address the system, the
							individuals, the interactions, and the boundary of the system.</li>
